<p>These preferences enable features that are considered experimental,
inserted to garner user feedback.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Show Tick Rate:</b> If checked, then when ticks are enabled, Logisim
displays a measurement of the rate at which it has been able to complete ticks.
The tick rate is measured by averaging over the previous 1,000 ticks.
(Disabling ticks or changing the maximum tick rate will clear its history.)</p>

<p>This actual tick rate may be much less than the selected tick rate, because
Logisim cannot simulate larger circuits at a very fast rate. For example,
Logisim's maximum speed for a
reasonably large circuit might be 16 Hz; you can select a faster tick rate,
but the actual speed will not exceed 16 Hz.</p></li>

<li><b>Graphics Acceleration:</b> One Logisim user observed
that adding <tt>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=True</tt> to the command line seemed
to improve Logisim's graphics performance by telling it to use hardware graphics
acceleration. This drop-down box attempts to
configure Logisim to set this up; reports about whether this drop-down box has
any effect on performance would be welcome. It won't have
any effect until Logisim is restarted.</p></li>
