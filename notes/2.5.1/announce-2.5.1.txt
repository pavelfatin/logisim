Feature: Added the "Get Project Statistics" menu item and the "-tty stats" command-line option.

Feature: The integrated help system now includes full-text search. Also, the most recent version of the JavaHelp library is packaged with Logisim.

Feature: Added Control Line Location to Controlled Buffer and Controlled Inverter, and added Gate Size attribute to the Controlled Inverter.

Feature: Increased the maximum number of inputs for gates to 32. 

Feature: Added a third, larger Gate Size option to the multi-input logic gates, which may look better for very large numbers of inputs. What was called "Wide" before is now "Medium."

Feature: The color and font dialogs were modified so that their strings could more easily be translated. A Russian translation is included.

Bug fix: In 2.5.0, Logisim projects were opened assuming a UTF-8 encoding, and it refused to open files with invalid encoding. It now first attempts opening the file assuming UTF-8 encoding (since that is now the default save format); but if that fails, it attempts to open the file using the platform's default encoding.

Bug fix: In previous versions, projects were saved using the platform's default encoding (even though the XML indicated it used UTF-8), leading files to be non-portable if they included non-ASCII characters. Now the file is always saved using UTF-8.

Bug fix: Using DIN 40700 gate shapes, the OR and NOR gates were drawn improperly for even numbers of inputs.

Bug fix: With the font dialog library, changes to the selected language would not be reflected until the program was restarted.

Interface change: The shaped OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates are drawn slightly differently, using Java's GeneralPath class. As a result, the corners connect well and the "wings" for a large number of inputs don't get overly deep. 

Internal modification: All references to the JDOM library were removed, using Java's integrated XML libraries instead.
