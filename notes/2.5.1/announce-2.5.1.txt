Bug fix: In 2.5.0, Logisim projects were opened assuming a UTF-8 encoding, and it refused to open files with invalid encoding. It now first attempts opening the file assuming UTF-8 encoding (since that is now the default save format); but if that fails, it attempts to open the file using the platform's default encoding.

Bug fix: In previous versions, projects were saved using the platform's default encoding (even though the XML indicated it used UTF-8), leading files to be non-portable if they included non-ASCII characters. Now the file is always saved using UTF-8.

Feature: The integrated help system now includes full-text search. Also, the most recent version of the JavaHelp library is packaged with Logisim.

??? Feature: The color and font dialogs were modified so that their strings could be translated. A Russian translation is included. 

Internal modification: All references to the JDOM library were removed, using Java's integrated XML libraries instead.
