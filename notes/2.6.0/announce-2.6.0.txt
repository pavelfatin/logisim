Feature: You can customize how a subcircuit component will be drawn, in place of the default rectangle-with-notch appearance earlier.

Feature: When the poke tool is selected, clicking a subcircuit will lead a magnifying glass to appear over the subcircuit, and double-clicking in the magnifying glass will enter the subcircuit's state.

Feature: Multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, and priority encoders all support 5 "Select Bits."

Feature: The Arithmetic library now includes a "Bit Adder" which computes the number of 1 bits in its input(s).

Feature: The I/O library's LED has an "Off Color" attribute.

Feature: The facing of a subcircuit can be changed after it is placed into a circuit. 

Bug fix: After removing a circuit from the project, an Undo would place the removed circuit at the end of the project's list rather than back in its previous location.

Bug fix: When loading more than 4,096 memory entries into RAM or ROM, if the 4,096th entry (or a multiple of 4096 entries) was at the end of a line in the text file, all subsequent entries were ignored.

Bug fix: When the circuit is scaled using the zoom controls, tool tips would show up in the wrong location.

Bug fix: A "ConcurrentModificationException" was observed from the EventSourceWeakSupport class. It was changed to guarantee that it does not occur there.

Bug fix: Sometimes a diagonal line would appear across the layout when you selected a different component to be added.

Interface change: The menu shortcut for moving up in the state hierarchy is now MenuKey+Shift+Up, since MenuKey+Up is used for raising the selection.

Interface change: When the grid is being shown and the zoom factor is 200% or more, each grid dot is actually a square of several pixels.

Interface change: The project toolbar is drawn slightly differently, with a darker "add" icon, and of course the added elements for selecting to edit the layout or the appearance. Behind the scenes, the icons are drawn differently - this will likely be most apparent under MacOS X, where it was fairly ugly before.

Interface change: Subcircuits are drawn (by default) with a slightly different notch to adapt to the quadratic Bezier curve supported by the customized appearance module.

Interface change: The explorer pane's magnifying glass is drawn with a hint of blue in its center.

Architectural change: Subcircuits are implemented using the newer logisim.instance API rather than the deprecated logisim.comp API.


TODO:

(not a problem?) cut/copy sometimes does not work immediately after selecting view
(not a problem?) When a component is selected, sometimes an attempt to change to an attribute in the attribute table changes the attribute, but the table is not updated to reflect it.
save appearance zoom/show grid as part of file

Deferred:

refine when the Raise/Lower menu option is enabled
probe tool - adds display of probe value inside circuit layout
