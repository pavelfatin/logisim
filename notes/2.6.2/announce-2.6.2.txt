Feature: If you go to the Preference window's Window tab and check "Show Tick Rate," Logisim will measure the actual rate of ticks and display it in the canvas's upper right corner. For complex circuits, the circuit cannot be simulated at the faster rates listed in the Simulate menu, and so the measured tick rate can be much less than what the user has selected.

Feature: Several configuration items were moved from the project-specific Options dialog into the application-wide Preferences dialog, since users are unlikely to want the values to vary between projects. This includes all items formerly under the Option window's Canvas tab and the Toolbar Location item under its Toolbar tab. These were moved into the application-wide Preferences dialog's new Window and Layout tabs.

Feature: Several window attributes are automatically saved as preferences when the user exits (though they don't appear in the dialog) so they can be restored to their previous values on the next startup. This includes the tick rate, window size, zoom factor for both the layout editor and appearance editor, whether to show the grid in the layout editor and appearance editor grid, whether the window is maximized, and the portion of the window dedicated to the main canvas, the explorer pane, and the attribute table.

Feature: Added Open Recent submenu to the File menu. 

Feature: A first version of the German documentation is included.

Bug fix: The tick rate would default to 1 KHz, although the initially checked tick rate was 1 Hz.

Bug fix: The project toolbar would appear at startup regardless of whether its menu item was checked

Bug fix: In loading from a file into RAM or ROM, very long strings of non-zero values would see large portions treated as zero.

Bug fix: In editing the appearance and creating a rectangle, oval, or rounded rectangle, there would sometimes be artifacts left behind as the mouse was dragged.

Implementation change: The documentation's directory hierarchy was changed to facilitate easier translation.
