Feature: If you go to the Preference window's Window tab and check "Show Tick Rate," Logisim will measure the actual rate of ticks and display it in the canvas's upper right corner. For complex circuits, the circuit cannot be simulated at the faster rates listed in the Simulate menu, and so the measured tick rate can be much less than what the user has selected.

Feature: Several configuration items were moved from the project-specific Options dialog into the application-wide Preferences dialog, since users are unlikely to want the values to vary between projects. This includes all items formerly under the Option window's Canvas tab and the Toolbar Location item under its Toolbar tab. These were moved into the application-wide Preferences dialog's new Window and Layout tabs.

Feature: Several window attributes are automatically saved as preferences when the user exits (though they don't appear in the dialog) so they can be restored to their previous values on the next startup. This includes the tick rate, window size, zoom factor for both the layout editor and appearance editor, whether to show the grid in the layout editor and appearance editor grid, whether the window is maximized, and the portion of the window dedicated to the main canvas, the explorer pane, and the attribute table.

Feature: Added Open Recent submenu to the File menu.

Feature: Added a "-clearprops" command-line option that clears all saved application preferences on startup.

Feature: In the I/O library, the Joystick component's Bit Width attribute can be configured through pressing Alt-2 through Alt-5.

Feature: A first version of the Portuguese translation is included.  

Feature: A first version of the German documentation is included.

Appearance change: Rectangular XOR and XNOR gates are drawn with "=1" to conform to the ISO standard (previously it was simply "1"). However, if the "Multiple-Input Behavior" attribute is "When an odd number are on" and there are more than two inputs, the label is "2k+1" to reflect that it is actually doing an odd parity. (Previously it showed this label for odd parity even when there were just two inputs.)

Bug fix: The tick rate would default to 1 KHz, although the initially checked tick rate was 1 Hz.

Bug fix: Libraries could not be unloaded.

Bug fix: The XNOR gate incorrectly did even parity by default, rather than being off only when exactly one input is one.

Bug fix: Most options were not loaded when a file was later reopened (all except the toolbar and mouse mappings).

Bug fix: The Logisim version saved in the project file was not interpreted correctly when opening the project. One consequence: If you edited the toolbar to include the Select and Wiring tools, they would be replaced by the Edit tool when reloaded.

Bug fix: When moving a selection so that one wire in the selection is moved exactly into the location of a wire being moved, the wire would sometimes disappear entirely rather than be moved. 

Bug fix: With the Select Tool, pressing the backspace key deletes the current selection (just as it does when the delete key is pressed).

Bug fix: The project toolbar would appear at startup regardless of whether its menu item was checked

Bug fix: When elements are duplicated, the attribute table does not allow changes to those elements to occur until the elements are deselected and reselected.

Bug fix: When adding a subcircuit, the "ghost" would not be drawn faded as with other regular components.

Bug fix: When a subcircuit element is selected and the Circuit Name altered through the attribute table, the updated value would not always be reflected in the attribute table.

Bug fix: In loading from a file into RAM or ROM, very long strings of non-zero values would see large portions treated as zero.

Bug fix: When a rectangle, oval, or rounded rectangle in a circuit's appearance had a paint type of "Border & Fill" and it was filled with solid black, that information was not properly stored in the saved file.

Bug fix: In editing the appearance and creating a rectangle, oval, or rounded rectangle, there would sometimes be artifacts left behind as the mouse was dragged.

Bug fix: Edits to the Bit Extender's Extension Type attribute or the Comparator's did not have an immediate effect in the circuit.

Bug fix: Under MacOS X, the title bar's close-window button would indicate that the file was changed after the first change, but the indicator would not disappear when the file was saved.

Interface change: A customized application icon is configured to appear in each window's title bar, where the Java logo had previously appeared.

Implementation change: The documentation's directory hierarchy was changed to facilitate easier translation.
