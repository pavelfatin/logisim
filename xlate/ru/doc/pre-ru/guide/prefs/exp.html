<p>These preferences enable features that are considered experimental,
inserted to garner user feedback.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Graphics Acceleration:</b> Several Logisim users have reported
that Logisim seems quite slow at rendering graphics. One user observed
that adding <tt>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=True</tt> to the command line seemed
to address this completely. You can attempt to control this using a
drop-down box. I haven't myself observed speed problems
in Logisim, so I can't evaluate its effectiveness; I'm relying on user
reports about whether this helps. Note that it certainly won't have
any effect until Logisim is restarted.</p></li>
