<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>This component exists only for backwards compatibility
with Logisim 1.0<var>X</var>; for new circuits, the
<a href="../mem/register.html">Memory library's register</a> is
recommended instead.</p>

<p>The register stores a single 8-bit value, which is displayed in
hexadecimal within its rectangle, and is emitted via its outputs on its
east edge.  (Logisim 1.0<var>X</var> did not support multi-bit values,
so the register had to have a pin for each individual bit.) At the
instant when the clock input (indicated by a triangle on the west edge)
rises from 0 to 1, the value stored in the register changes to the value
specified through the eight other bits on the west edge.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

<dt>East edge, eight pins (outputs, bit width 1 each)
<dd>Outputs the value currently stored by the register, with the
lowest-order bit at the northmost pin.

<dt>West edge, eight pins (inputs, bit width 1 each)
<dd>At the instant that the clock value rises from 0 to 1,
the register's value changes to the value of the inputs at
that instant. The lowest-order bit is at the northmost pin.

<dt>West edge, indicated with a triangle (input, bit width 1)
<dd>Clock input: At the instant that this input value rises from 0 to
1 (the rising edge), the register's value will be updated to the values
of the other inputs on the west edge.

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Clicking the register brings keyboard focus to the register
(indicated by a red rectangle), and typing hexadecimal digits will
change the value stored in the register.</p>

<h2>Text Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>None.</p>
